*Lit AF* – just one example of today’s new slang, also coined
cyber-slang or netspeak (due to it being primarily used on social
media), that has infiltrated our vocabulary. From daily conversation to
communication via social media, these terms have popped up, seemingly
out of nowhere. Their frequent usage allows them to embed themselves and
their meanings into our lives, becoming conventional terms used by our
generation, and giving a new measure for what it means to be literate.
However, apart from a quick search on the trusty Urban Dictionary to
understand the meaning of these new slang terms, most of their origins
remain mostly unknown. So, if you’ve ever wondered how these slang terms
came to be, here is a lowdown on the rich histories of three popular
slang terms used today.

<br>

####Lit

Derived from the word english word “light”, *lit* has its roots in
Dutch, German, and other Germanic languages. Besides its more well-known
(and earliest recorded) meaning of providing light, *lit* also means to
cause something to start burning or to discover something. However, in
the early 1900s, a slang term for *lit* had developed, suggesting *lit*
to mean intoxication, more specifically through alcohol, as seen through
publications of the period.


![](../static/img/slangs/media/quote1.png)
*According to the Oxford English Dictionary which cited 1914’s
publication of Choice Slang , “lit” has had the meaning of drunk or
intoxicated since the 1900s.*

![](../static/img/slangs/media/quote2.png)
*Unlikely heroine Ida Arnold from Graham Greene’s famous 1938 novel
Brighton Rock explains slightly wistfully, “If I hadn’t been a bit lit
this wouldn’t have happened.”*

As time passed, *intoxication* also began to acquire a wider scope of
meaning, which in turn led to the widening of *lit*’s scope of meaning
to also include the effects of drugs in addition to the effects of
alcohol by the early 1970s.

E. E. Landy’s 1971 *Underground Dictionary* defined “lit up” as “under
the influence of a narcotic.”

While currently, *lit* is still used to describe intoxication through
drugs and alcohol, it’s meaning has also further widened to include
excitement in general. Though rappers have played a part in giving this
fresh new meaning to the term (through the general description of
parties being *lit*, referring to the drunken atmosphere, and the
resulting excitement in the air), a large part of this new 21st century
meaning to *lit* has been cemented through its extremely frequent
appearance on Twitter, becoming a popular hashtag to describe excitement
in general.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image6.png)

In the song, the rapper talks about getting intoxicated through drugs;
however, he also talks about his excitement for the good times and the
people he's excited to have those good times with, making it clear that
his girls and friends are just as *lit* as Cannabis.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image14.png)

Tweets today using the hashtag *\#lit* to describe excitement in general

Thus, today’s popular slang definition of *lit* has come to mean
excitement in a general sense, as well as a broader meaning of something
along the lines of excellent.

<br>

#### Woke/Stay Woke

Today, while the meaning of *woke* still remains as the past tense of
wake (a word that sprung from Dutch, German and other Germanic languages
with the general meaning of gaining consciousness), *woke* has also
become teen internet slang for “a state of awareness in current
political affairs”. Similarly to *lit*, *woke* had also seemed to become
popularised through social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram,
with the trending hashtag *\#staywoke* appearing on more than 128,000
posts. Not only has it been used ironically and jokingly, but
\#*staywoke* has also been used to urge people to be aware of a plethora
of social and political affairs, such as racism, feminism, and other
issues.

A selection of posts on Twitter depicting how the usage of \#*staywoke*
ranges from urging people to stay aware issues such as feminism and
racism, to discovering the art and beauty of a method of semi-permanent
hair removal.

However, while MTV declared *woke* a new slang term for 2016, history
has proven this to be incorrect, bringing its rich political history to
light. The earliest recorded instance of *woke* actually occurred on 20
May 1962, appearing in an article on white beatniks appropriating black
culture in the New York Times.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image17.png)

Titled “If You’re Woke, You Dig It” by African-American novelist William
Melvin Kelley, the NY Times magazine published a piece on white beatniks
appropriating black culture on 20 May 1962. The article also included a
cartoon depicting the appropriation of such African-American Vernacular
English (AAVE) by the younger white people.

For the next few decades, the term continued to appear, with evidence of
it being used in a more explicit political context. In a 1972 play
entitled *Garvey Lives!*, author Barry Beckham writes, “I been sleeping
all my life. And now that Mr. Garvey done woke me up, I’m gon stay woke.
And I’m gon help him wake up other black folk.” This depicted Strong’s
realisation of how he had been politically unaware of the lack of
African American empowerment until Mr Garvey raised his aware on this
issue, and his determination to continue to stay aware and spread this
newfound awareness thus urged him to “stay woke”. These examples, among
others, provide evidence that *woke* had originally held a solely
pro-black political meaning.

However, the term had mostly stayed dormant, until its feature in
[Erykah Badu](http://fusion.net/story/252567/stay-woke/) 2008 song
*Master Teacher*.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image10.png)

In her 2008 song *Master Teacher*, Badu, along with Bilal and Georgia
Anne Muldrow, sang about how they dream of racial equality, but still
“*stay woke*” as they understand their dream is far from reality.

While Badu’s song was considered the first major usage of the phrase
“*stay woke*”, most people had simply brushed off the phrase in 2008,
with some even claiming it to be just another case of improper grammar.
Even in the years following the release of the song, the phrase stayed
out of the spotlight, only to come back full-force with the 2012 Black
Lives Matter movement.

Public outrage which engendered the Black Lives Matter movement was
first sparked when the criminal court in Florida decided not to convict
George Zimmerman. With the reveal of the case to the public, protests
soon followed, which blew up over social media in the form of the
hashtag, *\#blacklivesmatter* and most importantly, *\#staywoke*. The
hashtag *\#staywoke* became a significant term to the African American
community, serving as a neatly packaged term to bring support to each
other in these trying times, a way to remind each other to stay strong
and put up a united front in the face of such injustice. The two terms,
*\#staywoke* and *\#blacklivesmatter,* worked hand in hand as a powerful
force used by thousands of Twitter users to uncover the stories of more
black lives that had been lost due to racism in America, the phenomenon
known today as the 2012 Black Lives Matter movement.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image20.png)

On February 26, 2012, George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin.
Zimmerman was initially charged with second-degree murder, and
subsequently was found not guilty.

In the same year as the 2012 Black Lives Matter movement, Badu’s Russian
rock group, Pussy Riot, was threatened with jail time for staging a
sexually-charged queer protest performance. Badu responded by taking to
Twitter to urge her followers to \#*staywoke,* which was the first known
use of *\#staywoke* being used outside of its solely race-related
political awareness.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image12.png)

Thus, the combination of these events ultimately led to Twitter users
posting tweets using the *\#staywoke* hashtag to urge others to remain
aware of these social issues. This allowed *woke* to acquire a new
meaning, where it served as not only a call for awareness on racism, but
other issues as well, thus becoming the iconic slang term that it is
today. While this term served alongside *\#blacklivesmatter* as a
rallying cry for the modern civil rights movement, it slowly began to
transform into a meme.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image11.png)
*An example of the memeification of the phrase stay woke *

While the idea of *stay woke* being a cry for awareness continued to
remain intact, its newly developed meaning gave room for people to
attach the term to ridiculous things, such as calling awareness to the
obvious or trivial, as seen in the example above. While using the
hashtag jokingly seems like harmless fun, the irony of its use may come
across as a derogatory jab to its origins, resulting in discontent from
its original community. Like many other slang terms adapted from the
African American Vernacular English (AAVE), it was only a matter of time
before *woke* became a mainstream term. However, being a word that had
once served as a legitimate rallying force for black people to remind
one another to be conscious of their struggles, the “loss” of this term
to mainstream culture was a painful blow to the African American
community. From the writers of The New York Times and The Boston Globe
lashing out at this “cultural appropriation”, to the African American
community having discussions on Twitter about how deeply racism is woven
into American society, there was a sense of loss that came with the
mockery of the slang term when its original meaning and symbolism made a
descent into the meme territory.

Personally, while I do believe English is a living and breathing
language where it is the norm for words and their meanings to constantly
change and adapt depending on its audience, I find myself torn with
regards to this particular case. With people everywhere posting videos
of themselves “twerking” or claiming to be “on fleek” with their “baes”,
the appropriation of AAVE as mainstream terms is nothing new or
surprising anymore. However, unlike the previous terms adapted into
mainstream culture, *stay woke* carries a certain weight in the black
community due to its origins. While the words do not mean much to people
outside of the black community, to African Americans, they mean things
like staying safe, and being aware of police brutality and white
supremacy. The words are a neat little package to bring support and
awareness to fellow African Americans in brutal times. Thus, to see such
powerful words used in trivial and meaningless situations does seem like
a degradation of sorts, a mockery of the strong rallying force it is
supposed to represent. While its pro-black meaning will never truly be
felt and embodied by the people outside of the black community, perhaps
for one outside of the black community to be truly *woke*, one must
first understand how the term had roused in the first place before being
able to identify with it or use it.

#### Mug / Mugger

Lastly, here’s a word that is special that many Singaporeans use –
*mug*. Singlish (Singapore English), being a relatively young and new
variation of English, lacks the depth of research and variety of
concrete evidence compared to other older variations of English.
However, this does not mean that the history of Singlish is not just as
interesting. A term well known to many Singaporeans, *mug* means to
study by rote. Thus, a *mugger* refers to a hardworking student who
memorises notes and regurgitates them during exams. Additionally, in the
Singaporean context, the term seems to hold a slightly derogatory
meaning, as it hints at the student being one to rush things at the last
minute and also being able to regurgitate information, instead of
processing and actively thinking.

If we trace back the history of the term, we would find that the first
recorded usage of *mug* with a similar meaning to today’s Singlish *mug*
was in an 1800s British Magazine. This is not much of a surprise,
considering Singapore was under the British rule for over a hundred
years. This, as well as other British publications, had established
*mug* to also have the meaning of studying or learning in a concentrated
manner.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image18.png)

[*The King's College
Magazine*](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tW4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA235&dq=mugging&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e_oBU53TLKye4wTF-4GQBA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mugging&f=false)
of November 1841 (p.235, "Our School Days" by C.H.H.) was the first
recorded usage of *mug*, which meant to read or study in a concentrated
manner.

![](../static/img/slangs/media/image15.png)

*Mug*, in the early 1800s, meant to learn (a subject, book etc.) by hard
or concentrated study, as seen in 1856 [*Aldershottana:
Or, Chinks in my hut*](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HLQBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA23&dq=%22mugging%20up%22%20%20%20OR%20%22mugged%20up%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BAcCU8acEszo4QSb6oGgDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22mugging%20up%22%20%20OR%20%22mugged%20up%22&f=false)

This usage of *mug*, however, was considered a slang term of the 1800s,
and thus had many different interpretations of how it came to be. The
interpretations mainly split into two wings – one wing believed that the
slang originated from one of the term’s original meanings, while the
other wing believed that it was derived from other informal (slang)
meanings of *mug.* The first wing believed that the slang term had
originated from its original meaning of “cup”, as one would usually have
a mug of coffee or tea while studying in order to keep themselves awake,
or its other meaning of robbing someone, as one would be robbed
(“mugged”) of sleep or rest. The second wing believed that the slang
term had actually emerged from the other informal (or slang) meanings of
mug. For instance, a slang meaning of mug is a stupid person, and thus
one needed to *mug up* in order to be less of a mug. Another slang
meaning of “mug” is a person’s face, and thus, many believed that one’s
“mug” came very close to the books when studying intensely, thereby
dubbing this act as *mugging*. However, due to the uncertain origins of
this slang term, one can interpret how it came about in whichever way
they see fit.

All in all, the addition of cyber-slang into modern-day vocabulary has
not only provided many new meanings to several words, but also changed
the idea of what it means to be literate. Apart from being able to read,
write, and understand the traditional meanings of words, one must now
also be able to understand the new slang meanings and differentiate them
from their traditional meanings to be considered literate. While many
have criticised our “new” slang terms for being a corruption of the
English Language, English, being a humble West Germanic Language and
adapting many of its terms from other languages such as Latin, Greek,
and German, could also be seen as a corruption of other languages. Thus,
these slang terms can be seen as the mark that our generation leaves on
the ubiquitous English language, similar to what the generations before
us have done.

Whether or not the words’ meanings are as politically charged as *stay
woke* or as uncertain as *mug*, they all reveal the ever changing nature
of the English language, and how new meanings are born again and again,
giving old words a way to live through new generations, whilst carrying
the weight of its original meanings that will eventually be discovered
by the next in line.
