In a recent address to the United Nations General Assembly on September
20, 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the
challenges that the First Nations people of Canada have faced for
decades. He stated, “For Indigenous peoples in Canada, the experience
was mostly one of humiliation, neglect and abuse.”

Indeed, this has been a problem that can be traced back even to Canada’s
colonial days, where Eurocentric beliefs led the government to pass many
laws that stripped the First Nations people of their pride and culture.
One of the most controversial laws passed by the government was the
Indian Act of 1876, which gave the government the authority to interfere
with many aspects of First Nations’ affairs, ranging from concerns with
regards to their land and money, to controlling their access to
intoxicants. Since its inception, this act has been subject to severe
criticism. Canadian historian Ken Coates claims that the act “is the
prime example of the intrusiveness of the Canadian state into the lives
of Aboriginal people in this country.” The Indian Act has undergone many
amendments throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, which is a testimony
to the changes in public opinion throughout history. However, the
lasting effects of the act cannot be understated, especially considering
the many attempts made to “tame the savages” by assimilating the First
Nations people into Canadian culture and strip them of many fundamental
human rights. Not only was the right to make decisions taken away from
the First Nations people, but rights to religion and education were also
taken away. This discrimination led to sky-rocketing poverty rates in
First Nations communities, as well as high suicide and depression rates
that far surpassed the national average.

The intrusiveness of the Canadian government cannot be discussed without
paying special attention to residential schools - church-run
institutions aimed to assimilate First Nations children into Canadian
culture and in doing so, “taming the savages”. First established in 1883
under the Indian Act, First Nation children were forced to separate from
their families and live in harsh and abusive institutions. Culturally
deprived and isolated, these children were often beaten and abused by
their overseers, many of whom were uninformed about First Nation culture
and believed that it was their duty to educate the “savages”. Elaine
Durocher, a residential school survivor, explained this situation, “They
were there to discipline you, teach you, beat you, rape you, molest you,
but I never got an education.” Many others like Elaine still have
lasting scars from their time in residential schools, wounds that would
continue to haunt them years after these incidents.

Yet, this attempt to assimilate First Nations into Canadian culture was
not only limited to children. The Canadian government outlawed the
practice of many First Nations traditions, such as Potlatch ceremonies,
a First Nations celebration ceremony. These ceremonies were held on
several occasions for a variety of purposes, including the passing of
titles, names, or responsibilities from a chief to his eldest son, or
during weddings, funerals, and the establishment of rank. Government
officers and missionaries described the festivals as “debauchery of the
worst kind”, as they were considered by the Deputy
Superintendent-General to generate “pernicious effects” on Indians. This
clearly highlighted the idea that there were several misconceptions
about the First Nations people’s cultural practices. However, the
outlawing of this practice only served to drive it underground. One of
the most famous underground potlatch ceremonies with the purpose of
celebrating a wedding was held by Namgis Chief Dan Cranmer during the
Christmas of 1921. The six-day long celebration was detected by
government officials, and resulted in 45 people being arrested and
charged, and 22 people being jailed. Although the ban was removed in
1951, the consequences are unable to be reversed, and still remain to
this day – countless cultural artifacts have been lost or destroyed, and
generations of tradition have been lost in a mere 71 years.

It was only in the last 50 years that the Canadian government began
taking actions to redress past wrongdoings towards the First Nations
people. The late 1960s marked a major shift in public attitude towards
aboriginal peoples. Due to many civil rights movements and the
aboriginals’ contributions to the First and Second World Wars, Canadians
began to question discrimination and mistreatment towards them. One of
the first initiatives to redress these wrongs was introduced by Justin
Trudeau’s father Pierre Trudeau, who began a new approach in 1969 with
regards to dealing with First Nation affairs. His policy was based on
the vision of a “just society”, which mandated that Canadians should be
entitled to the same rights regardless of their ethnicity, language, or
history. Commonly known as the “White Paper”, Pierre Trudeau’s proposal
called for the repealing of the Indian Act and removal of the “Indian
status” held by First Nations people. However, despite the efforts of
the Canadian government to right past wrongs for the first time in
decades, many First Nations communities were not convinced. Many
believed that the government had overlooked long standing concerns of
the First Nations people, and viewed this initiative as a “final attempt
to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the Canadian population.”
Furthermore, the government’s failure to consult with the First Nations
people prior to the proposal was severely criticised by many. Harold
Cardinal, a major critic of the paper, called it “a thinly disguised
programme of extermination through assimilation” in his book *The Unjust
Society*.

It would take years of change before the First Nations people of Canada
started to feel more integrated into Canadian society. Following the
significant backlash from the First Nations community following the
publishing of The White Paper, the Trudeau government began to develop
new policies to mend relationships with the First Nations. A very
notable shift in aboriginal policies was observed in 1975, with the
commencing of negotiations between the Canadian government and First
Nations groups to re-negotiate old treaties. The shift from an
independent decision making process to a joint effort shows a dramatic
shift towards Pierre Trudeau’s idea of a “just society”. Since 1975,
there have been a total of 22 comprehensive claims agreements (modern
treaties) negotiated, providing the First Nations people with freedom in
governing and living in their own land.

With the continued success of Trudeau’s policies in the First Nations
community, his administration continued to develop policies to further
redress the mistakes of the Canadian government in the past. In 1998,
Canada finally acknowledged its role in the abuse and mistreatment of
Aboriginal peoples in residential schools, and in 2007, the Minister of
Indian and Northern Affairs announced the “Common Experience Package”, a
$2 billion compensation package for residential school survivors. This
was largely successful, as $1.62 billion was paid to 78,750 residential
school survivors, who represented 98% of the 80,000 estimated former
students, by the end of 2012. Moreover, the rebirth of old traditions
has been a defining feature of the 21st century, especially with the
Canadian government providing funds to indigenous schools. Previously
banned practices such as potlatch ceremonies began to re-emerge, and
traditional languages such as Cree and Mi’kmaq began being spoken by the
younger generation. Through the support of the First Nations community,
young people across Canada are now able to learn about the traditions
and culture of the aboriginals that have been passed down for
generations, and are reminded not to fear a culture that they do not
understand, but instead embrace it.

Living in the free and accepting society that Canada is today, it is
hard to imagine how less than 75 years ago, the government was condoning
practices that were discriminatory towards many of its own people. In
school, we are taught to be accepting of all people regardless of the
colour of their skin or their religion, which is what I believe must be
established in order to maintain our vision of a free and democratic
society. Gone were the days when we took away the cultures and
traditions of others who did not fit into the ordinary social mould in
order to provide ourselves with a sense of pride and accomplishment. In
a world that is so divisive, working together to create a better society
for everyone – including the First Nations people – has become all the
more important for Canadians.

With the election of a new Prime Minister in 2015, many aboriginal
people in Canada continue to hold hopes that Justin Trudeau will follow
in his father’s footsteps in bringing equality to the First Nations
people of Canada. These hopes seem to turning into reality, considering
the younger Trudeau’s promises to “\[close\] socio-economic gaps,
\[support\] greater self-determination and \[establish\] opportunities
to work together on shared priorities.” However, these promises have yet
to manifest themselves as tangible action. Only time will tell if Prime
Minister Trudeau’s government will succeed in bringing equality to
communities who have had to endure discrimination and abuse for over a
century.
