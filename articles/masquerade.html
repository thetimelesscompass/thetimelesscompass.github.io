The Venetian Carnival is easily the most famous of all Italian
carnivals, and is one of the most prominent carnivals of all time. It
has been traced back to 1162 and had taken place continuously until it
was banned in 1797. However, it was brought back in 1979 as part of the
Italian government’s efforts to celebrate Venetian tradition and
history.

The carnival has been referred to a “season of excess, riot and social
inversion”, due to the many extravagant, decadent and sinful activities
that took place during the carnival. So what exactly were the types of
activities that occurred at this carnival?

#### Bull-baiting

Bull-baiting, or *cacce dei tori*, was one of the more grandiose events
of the carnival. In Piazza San Marco, the largest square in Venice
located in front of the Doge’s (chief magistrate and most senior leader
of the Venetian republic) palace, as many as a hundred bulls were
released at once into the piazza. Afterwards, an “unmerciful” number of
dogs were set loose to maul and attack the bulls. Supposedly, Corsican
dogs, known to have been the fiercest breed in Italy, were bred
specifically for the sport.

Bull-baiting was an expensive amusement for the Venetian aristocracy,
especially the royalty, who were annual organisers of the event during
the carnival.

Interestingly, bull-baiting in Venice was treated as a festive event
with a “high degree of emphasis on ritual, fancy dress, and athletic
dexterity”. This was, however, a distinct contrast compared to what
bull-baiting represented in other Italian states, where the peasants,
who were symbolised by the dogs, were meant to rise up against the
oppressive aristocrat, who were symbolised by the bull.

#### Gambling

The world’s first public gambling house, also known as *Il Ridotto*,
originated from Venice in 1638. Built inside a wing of Palazzo Dandolo,
it was highly frequented during the Venetian Carnival. Sanctioned by the
government to control public gambling, it was open to all but
discriminated against peasants and the middle-class by requiring players
to wear three-cornered hats and masks, which were unaffordable to most.
This meant that they had to find alternatives. Although gambling (with
stakes) outside of the Ridotto was considered illegal, closed gambling
clubs were popular with the less wealthy.

With Venice being one of the only (and likely the first) locations to
offer gambling on a large and public scale, gambling became one of the
biggest attractions for tourists. In particular, young men on their
coming-of-age Grand Tour were known to make Venice a necessary pleasure
stop.

Despite being more famed for its elaborate masks and luxurious balls,
the Carnevale di Venezia had many more activities and traditions that
set it apart from any other festival in Europe. From gruesome and dark
activities like bull-baiting to glamorous and excessive gambling, the
carnival is said to be representative of an entertaining play, in which
the people donned masks and became anonymous actors, partaking in
indulgences and vices that were too fantastical to occur in ‘real-life’,
when the curtains came down and their masks peeled off.
