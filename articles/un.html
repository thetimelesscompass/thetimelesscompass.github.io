The United Nations has long become a “household name” for international
relations aficionados, and for everyone who has known Emma Watson as a
UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in 2014, or heard of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals in 2016. It took its place as an international
organisation that had oversight over countries around the world after
the Second World War, remaining active since 1945. 24 October 2017
marked the 72nd year of the UN, a true testament to its pertinence in
global affairs and politics.

The conception of the United Nations was preceded by the League of
Nations. Though organisations held similar goals of promoting
international cooperation and global security, the League of Nations was
a failure, losing its legitimacy and ultimately ceasing its activities
after it failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War, with
its existence lasting for no more than 20 years. The contrast between
the longevity two intergovernmental bodies thus raises the question –
what exactly led to the stark contrast in the effectiveness between the
two organisations?

To answer this, we need to first examine the mission of the League of
Nations. [*Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen
Points*](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=62), a
statement of principles for peace during the post-WWI negotiations,
included the recommendation for an “Association of Nations” to maintain
“Open Diplomacy”. Thus, peaceful arbitration and disarmament were on the
top of the League of Nations’ agenda. It was a shame that the agenda
remained unfulfilled for the most part ever since the 42-member strong
organisation’s establishment in 1919.

The deceptively large membership in the League belies a pernicious
problem, because some important countries were not part of it. The
vanquished combatants of World War I, Germany and Austria, were not
offered membership; the USSR was still distrusted because it was
governed by Communists; the USA, whose Wilsonian principles arguably
formed the bedrock of the organisation, was not a member either.
Instead, the helmsmen of the League of Nations were Britain and France:
the former essentially regarded the organisation as a “talking shop”,
while the latter grasped at any opportunity it had to insure itself
against Germany and wanted the League of Nations to enforce the harsh
Treaty of Versailles. It is conceivable, as such, that the League of
Nations would flounder when it was thrust into a pair of uncommitted,
and unreliable hands.

Moreover, a key covenant of the League was the emphasis on *collective*
security: all nations who were members were supposed to act in unity
against the aggressor. While each nation’s security may depend on that
of all other nations, it was not necessarily the case the other way
round — countries may not be *dependable* enough to ensure the security
of a particular nation. Hence, this underscored the difficulty that the
League faced when dealing with aggression from larger, more powerful
nations.

*Did the League of Nations represent more than just an idealistic utopia?
Image source:
[2993202.jpg](http://kcschwartz.weebly.com/uploads/8/3/6/4/8364070/2993202.jpg)*

One such example was the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria from 1931 to
1933. The aggression was triggered by the *Wanpaoshan* Incident in July
1931, a minor dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers that was
sensationalised in the Imperial Japan and Korean press to brew
anti-Chinese sentiments in the empire of Japan. This preceded the
*Mukden* Incident on 18 September 1931, otherwise known as the
Manchurian Incident, where the Japanese army staged a bomb explosion in
the railway in *Mukden*, claiming it was a calculated attack by the
Chinese, and warranted a formal invasion of Manchuria in order to
“protect” the railway. How did the League of Nations respond to this
burgeoning crisis? The League had merely “instructed” the Japanese
forces to withdraw from Manchuria, and established the Lytton Commission
of Inquiry led by the Earl of Lytton to investigate the situation. The
report stated that Japan was the aggressor, and argued that the Japanese
puppet state of *Manchukuo* should not be recognised, urging Manchurian
autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. When the findings of the Commission
were released in the General Assembly and a motion was passed to condemn
Japan as the aggressor in February 1933, the Japanese delegation stormed
out of the council. A month later, Japan formally withdrew from the
League of Nations. This was a stark embarrassment to the League and
whatever it stood for, and had set a terrible precedent, paving the way
for future belligerence from other fascist nations, such as Italy.

Italy had emerged from the War dissatisfied with the territorial gains
it had made, having only conquered dismal territories like Eritrea and
Somaliland. Ever since, Mussolini’s National Fascist Party (PNF) rose to
power in 1922, Italy adopted a nationalistic foreign policy, where its
government employed strong-arm tactics to have their demands met. Three
years later, in 1935, Italy launched a full-scale invasion of Abyssinia,
and the latter appealed to the League of Nations for urgent assistance.
The League responded with a moral condemnation of the aggressor — an
inconsequential act which Mussolini coolly brushed off. Furthermore, the
League attempted to impose economic sanctions, barring the sale on arms,
rubber and metals. Yet, no League member was willing to give up
potential payoffs for paltry principles. The US, fearing a loss of
trade, refused to participate in the economic sanctions; Britain and
France did not even close the Suez Canal they had co-owned, allowing
Italian troops and ammunition pass to sustain its war in Abyssinia,
allowing the continuation of bloodshed and gunfire when they should have
tried to cease it.

The legitimacy of the League of Nations as a platform for international
arbitration suffered a heavy blow when Minister of Foreign Affairs
Pierre Laval of France and Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare of Britain
carried out secret negotiations with Mussolini, a blatant disregard of
the League’s purpose. Laval, in the “Franco-Italian Agreement”, agreed
to cede parts of Somaliland (now known as Dijbouti) to Italy,
essentially giving the latter a free hand in dealing with Ethiopia. This
foreboded the Hoare-Laval Plan in December 1935, which enabled Italy to
control large areas of Abyssinia. When the flagrant deal was leaked in
the media, the two ministers were accused of betraying the Abyssinians
in fear of facilitating the deadly alliance of Fascist Italy and Nazi
Germany, and were forced to resign. While Italy did complete its
takeover of Abyssinia in 1936, it had done exactly what the British and
French feared most — Mussolini offered to establish an alliance with
Adolf Hitler.

This proverbial saying could wholly sum up the League of Nations: “The
road to hell is paved with good intentions.” The organisation had first
started out with the mission to truly make WWI “the war to end all
wars”, but unfortunately, failed in getting its member states invested
in this common vision of collective security.

#### The United Nations: Successes in Numerous Aspects

The impact of the United Nations in aiding cooperation can be discussed
in terms of the different ways it has helped individual states put aside
their own agendas and come to a consensus about what mankind as a whole
should aspire towards. Perhaps the bloody events of the Second World War
reminded countries of the devastating consequences if the refusal to
cooperate reaches an extreme.

The UN has served as a platform to promote international guidelines
regarding the treatment of individuals. To that end, it has helped to
draft numerous laws and conventions that aim to do just that. Countries
can attempt to grapple with their differing views to devise a consensus
on basic rights that all countries agree on.

For example, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child –
a set of guidelines about the basic rights every child should have – was
made effective in 1990. Countries which choose to ratify the Convention
must abide by such guidelines and must regularly report to a committee
regarding their progress in achieving the aims of the Convention.
Currently, with the exception of the United States, every member of the
UN has ratified the Convention. Two optional protocols have also been
ratified by over 160 countries. Apart from such guidelines, the Human
Rights Council also serves as an avenue for issues regarding human
rights to be discussed and tackled more concretely and specifically.

Apart from guidelines regarding human rights, the UN has also
facilitated the drafting of guidelines and laws in a myriad of areas,
ranging from the definition of naval territorial boundaries (the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), to the protection of the
environment (the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change),
to the use of chemical weapons in warfare (the Chemical Weapons
Convention). While the number of countries which have ratified these
different conventions vary (165 countries have ratified the UNCLOS but
only 65 have ratified the CWC), many people believe that these
conventions and treaties have been the most successful attempt at global
cooperation thus far.

Just like how the Human Rights Council tackles issues of human rights,
there too exist many specialised agencies that aim to address problems
in different areas. For instance, the UN's [World Food
Programme](http://www.wfp.org/) (WFP) provides food to 90 million people
per year, providing aid to those in war zones, areas affected by natural
disasters, and in poverty-stricken countries. It currently provides aid
to people in about 80 countries. There also exist numerous councils
where debate over certain types of issues can be conducted. The web page
of any Model UN conference will attest to this!

The UN has also allowed for a more efficient provision of aid to states
which require it. The UN, with its vast resources, is able to respond
much quicker than any individual nation can, allowing for a more
coordinated response. This becomes particularly important in times of
crisis. While developed countries may be able to pay for some or most of
the funds required to alleviate the impact of a crisis in the
short-term, most developing countries do not and must turn to external
sources for help. When every second wasted could mean the difference
between saving lives or letting them die, time is of the essence. In the
wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, one of the
deadliest natural disasters in history, the UN provided a multifaceted
response to aid impacted countries. For instance, in Indonesia, the most
hard-hit country, 400 tons of shelter and other emergency supplies were
delivered to an initial 100,000 people in Aceh province within days of
the disaster, helping to prevent any further loss of lives.

Furthermore, after times of conflict, the UN is also authorised (with
the approval of the Security Council) to send peacekeeping troops to
monitor areas torn by conflict, with the aim of creating conditions for
sustainable peace. UN peacekeepers — soldiers and military officers,
police officers and civilian personnel from many countries — monitor and
observe peace processes that emerge in post-conflict situations and
assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they have
signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including
confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral
support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social
development.

That being said, UN peacekeeping efforts are also deeply flawed,
especially because forces can only intervene with the permission of the
government with jurisdiction over the area. This means that the UN
cannot intervene in situations where the government is complicit in or
even actively playing a role in inciting conflict towards particular
groups of people.

In fact, even when peacekeeping forces are able to intervene, this may
not necessarily lead to better outcomes. As explained in the next
section, while the intentions of the UN are mostly good, the reality may
differ at times – the UN’s intervention may, in actuality, prove
ineffective in its ability to help.

#### The United Nations: Failures and Fiascos

The most notable failure of the United Nations to maintain peace and
security was seen in their inability to prevent, and stop, the Rwandan
Genocide in 1994. The genocide was grounded in racial tensions, where
Hutu forces sought the mass extermination of the Tutsis. The first
misstep of the UN was that it disregarded a cable consisting of the
proposals for intervention, despite having been warned of the imminent
genocide.

Following the start of the killings, the ineffectiveness of the UN
surfaced from its constrictive mandate, which disallowed UN forces on
the ground from using force to intervene. While a mandate, which serves
as a guide to keep the conduct of peacekeepers in check, appears to be
efficacious on a theoretical level, this is not the case in reality.
Branching out from the Rwandan Genocide, the static nature of
peacekeeping mandates are often the key reasons for the failure of a
mission. In an area of conflict, the dynamic nature of the situation on
the ground would naturally require effective and efficient response,
which then translates into a more flexible mandate. Understandably,
there are fears as to how the changing nature of mandates may lead to
misconduct, or inconsistent behaviours. Yet, a balance between ensuring
a certain level of flexibility, as well as adhering to the main guiding
principles behind the mandate, must be found.

The Rwandan Genocide, known as the worst failure in UN history, was not
only plagued by a restrictive mandate, but it also lacked willpower from
the permanent members of the Security Council. From the start, the
mission in Rwanda suffered from a severe lack of peacekeeping troops
that could effectively protect the Tutsis against the Hutus. However,
due to 18 American peacekeepers having died in the peacekeeping mission
in Somalia, which was compounded by 10 Belgian peacekeepers being killed
in Rwanda after the start of the genocide, countries of the UN grew
increasingly reluctant to provide troops, and/or allow for the troops
who were already stationed in Rwanda to intervene in the conflict.

![](../static/img/un/media/image8.jpg)
*Newspaper clippings of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide

This also marked the start of a trend, whereby developed countries grew
increasingly unwilling to send physical troops on UN peacekeeping
missions, opting to provide equipment or financial resources instead. In
fact, peacekeeping troops now mainly consist of personnel from less
developed countries, as seen from the permanent members of the security
council decreasing its troop contributions from 20% in 1994 to 5% in
2004. This may be an effective solution to cover missions in the short
run, but in the long run, as countries become more developed, we may end
up facing a manpower shortage. Without boots on the ground, the
plenitude of material resources would thus be redundant. Crucially,
however, the Rwandan Genocide should not be viewed in a vacuum. It may
appear to be the biggest failure in UN history, but perhaps, it is the
first step towards the reformation of the UN to improve on the current
limitations of their interventions, and work towards greater success as
an international organization that maintains peace and security around
the globe.

However, another key reason for the ineffectiveness of the UN in
handling peacekeeping missions is also the lack of effective cooperation
between itself, and the regional body in which the missions are held.
Significantly, most operations have been on the continent of Africa (9
out of 16 currently). This would hence call for greater coordination
between the UN and the African Union (AU), allowing for the
capitalisation on the strengths of each side. For example, monetary
resources and weaponry could be provided by the UN, which has greater
financial capabilities, while the AU could provide manpower due to its
proximity to the affected countries which would allow for quicker
deployment, as well as the soldiers being better able to connect with
the people on the ground. Yet, there are problems that plague such
cooperation — for example, both organisations view the roles of their
interventions differently. While the AU intervenes with the purpose of
establishing a peace, the UN only enters the country after peace has
been established, and seeks to maintain the said peace. Furthermore,
peacekeeping operations and their mandates are often decided by members
of the UN Security Council. However, as members are elected in the UNSC,
this may result in affected African countries, which had not been
selected for that particular term, being unable to voice their opinions.
Relievingly, the UN had commissioned a report on peacekeeping operations
— the Brahimi Report — in 2000. This called for increased cooperation
between the UN and regional bodies and other third parties.

#### Overall Impact of the UN

However, despite the failures of the UN, the organisation has evolved
and progressed significantly since its days as the League of Nations,
which was unable to prevent the outbreak of World War II due to the lack
of collective unity amongst member states. Comprising 192 member states
that are in support of its founding Charter, the UN is the only
organisation with the ability to take strong action on issues
confronting humanity in the 21st Century, including peace and security,
human rights and governance problems. The UN is also the one and only
platform for countries of all sizes to engage in meaningful dialogues,
as well as come up with solutions to pertinent world issues together.
Since its founding 72 years ago, the UN has played major roles in
combating terrorism, preventing genocides, promoting women’s
development, improving literacy and education, as well as reducing child
mortality through encouraging the signing of treaties and agreements
amongst countries.

24 October is known as the United Nations Day. This is the day in 1945
when the Charter of the United Nations entered into force. It is a day
where people from all over the world come together in celebration of the
impactful work accomplished by the United Nations, as well as raise
awareness on the aims and achievements of the UN. Although not widely
practiced in most countries, in 1971, the United Nations General
Assembly recommended that 24 October be observed by Member States as a
holiday. Instead, the UN Day is generally commemorated in various member
states through meetings, discussions and exhibits about the UN. In
Singapore, during UN Day in 2015, 6 landmarks in Singapore were lit up
in blue, which is the official colour of the UN, to commemorate the 70th
Anniversary of the UN and Singapore’s 50th year of membership in the
organisation as part of the ‘Turn the World UN Blue’ initiative.
Landmarks in other countries that joined this initiative include the
Empire State Building in New York, United States as well as the Sydney
Opera House in Sydney, Australia. Meanwhile this year, at the UN
Headquarters in New York, a concert themed ‘Potential in Diversity’ was
organised to commemorate this day.

Though the UN may not be the most successful avenue in instilling world
peace and has its moments of failure — from the Rwandan Genocide, where
the UN sent in too few peacekeeping troops to protect the Tutsis, to
poor collaboration between the African Union and the UN — it remains the
best platform for multilateral discussions. In the words of Singapore’s
current Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, ‘for better
or for worse, the UN is still our best bet for a world with global
peace, justice and fairness in the future.’ The state of the current UN
may not be perfect, but as the next generation of leaders and citizens,
we have the power to better the UN system, and to work together in
ensuring peace and stability in this world we call home.
