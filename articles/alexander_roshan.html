The Xinjiang Riots. The Kunming Stabbings. The multiple instances of
self-immolation in Tibet.

These are examples of incidents that bring scrutiny upon the handling of
ethnic issues by the mainland Chinese government. Since the founding of
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) has continued to incur the ire of the international
community for its alleged human rights violations. Beijing’s hard-lined
pursuit of suppression amongst ethnic minorities has additionally served
to exacerbate this backlash.

However, we must not overlook the historical roots of the Han-ethnic
tensions that lie within millenniums of conflict between Chinese
dynasties and various historical ethnic groups such as the Huns, Turks,
Tartars, Tibetans, to name a few. One of the most significant events
that highlights the struggles between ethnic groups in China and the
central government is the An Lushan (or An-Shi) Rebellion (安史之乱)
(755-763) during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), which continues to send
ripples through present-day Chinese policies.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image7.jpg)
*The Silk Road brought wealth and prosperity to the Tang Dynasty, as
well as an influx of foreign culture.*

For individuals with basic knowledge of Chinese history, the Tang
Dynasty would likely be synonymous with prosperity, the Silk Road and
Chinese Poems (唐诗). While the periods of Early Tang and the
flourishing High Tang before the Rebellion were characterised by the
great influx of foreign culture through the Silk Road, these periods of
openness have been recognised by future historians as a portent of
subsequent conflicts.

The An Lushan Rebellion was an uprising led by General An Lushan
(安禄山), a Turkic-Sogdian military governor of Fanyang Province (an
area near present-day Beijing). Although the uprising was eventually
suppressed by the Tang Dynasty, the death toll was an estimated 13 to 36
million people, making it one of the ten deadliest conflicts in human
history by body count, and the deadliest in terms of the percentage of
casualties to the total global population, given the global population
of approximately 200 million during this period.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image9.jpg)
*The flight of Emperor Xuanzong from the capital Chang’an (present-day
Xi’an). The imperial court was evacuated to the Southwestern province of
Sichuan, where the Emperor abdicated and his son, Emperor Suzong, took
over the throne.*

The revolt has been unanimously regarded by historians as a watershed in
Chinese history; it marked the end of the flourishing High Tang period
and the commencement of Middle Tang, which was plagued with a series of
smaller-scale revolts that brought the Tang Dynasty into steady decline.

However, it must be understood that the events in the Tang Dynasty were
manifestations of an increasingly xenophobic society, due to centuries
of the spread of *hu* (胡, foreign or more condescendingly, barbarian)
culture into northern China in the Six Dynasties (222-589). In a broad
sense, *hu* in this context was a term coined by the Han Chinese to
refer to the non-Han races such as the Turks, Sogdians, Tibetans, Arabs,
Huns, Khitans, etc. The derogatory meaning of “barbarian” originates
from the self-perceived cultural superiority of the Han Chinese. While
the existing xenophobia compelled ethnic rulers to adopt Han customs,
language and names to maintain control over the Han-majority population,
it also pressured ethnic minorities in the population to do the same and
identify more with the dominant Han people, to avoid ostracisation.

In fact, the Imperial Yang family of the short-lived Sui Dynasty
(581-618) and the Li family of the subsequent Tang Dynasty were of
partial *Xianbei* descent, but they were rapidly sinicised through the
adoption of Han Chinese traditions, Imperial court customs as well as
Chinese language and characters. The *Xianbeis* were proto-Mongols and
one of the major nomadic groups in Northern China. They played a
significant role in the politics of Medieval China, as various sinicised
Xianbei tribes established six significant empires of their own in the
period of the Six Dynasties. Despite the resultant loss of *Xianbei*
culture, the integration of the imperial Yang and Li families into the
Han society enabled them to gain recognition among the Han population.
Today, the Sui and Tang Dynasties are recognised in China as dynasties
of the Han people.

On top of the existing xenophobia, two prominent reforms in the Tang
Dynasty laid the foundation of revolt: the semi-professionalisation of
the army which resulted in the ceding of military power to the
*jiedushi* (节度使, or regional military leaders), and the relocation of
large populations of *hu* people into modern-day Hebei province, a
phenomenon also known as *huhua* (胡化), or barbarianisation. Military
commanders with minority ancestry (such as An Lushan) were promoted to
key positions during the gradual decentralisation of power from the
Imperial government. These regional commanders could wield as many as
hundreds of thousands of troops, and could operate as alternative
political centres apart from the central government.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image8.png)
*Map of Rebellion. It took eight years and three generation of Emperors
to suppress the Rebellion, which severely fractured and weakened the
Tang Dynasty.*

After the devastation brought about by the rebellion, Imperial
historians characterised the conflict as a foreign invasion of the *hu*
people subverting the Chinese regime, owing to An Lushan’s ethnic
background. Modern historians, however, attribute it to a mixture of
factors including the inherent structural weaknesses of the Tang regime,
plagued with ineffective policies and corruption.

However, both schools of thought endorse the prospect of ethnic
minorities posing a potential threat to the central Chinese regimes once
their power goes unchecked. This wariness against ethnic minorities was
fostered by the constant invasions by nomadic tribes from the North and
the West, as well as the resultant xenophobia among the Han Chinese.
Another crucial factor was the Tang Dynasty’s openness policy towards
foreigners and minorities, as the sudden influx of foreigners and *hu*
people into regions of China (such as Hebei) had upset the local ethnic
balance and diluted the predominant Han culture with foreign ones, while
creating drastically different spheres of political and cultural
influence from the capital.

Ineffective governance was also an important factor, as the weakening of
the central government and factionalisation of authority led to its
inability to counter the growing influence of regional military leaders,
making conditions favourable for the emergence of rebels. After the
Rebellion was contained, the influence of the central bureaucracy was
drastically reduced as the Tang Dynasty’s desire for peace also resulted
in the pardoning of many rebels. The emperor’s inability to regain
control over all the regional warlords made him a puppet, set to do the
bidding of the strongest garrison. For the next 144 years, the Tang
ceased to exist in all but name, a far cry from its former days of
glory.

Yet, the emergence of minority groups as a potential destabilising
factor in Chinese politics did not conclude at the end of the Tang
Dynasty. In fact, this phenomenon observed during the An Lushan
Rebellion continues to serve as an impetus in shaping contemporary
Chinese ethnic policies.

The aftermath of the Rebellion made subsequent dynasties and governments
realise the importance of grappling with the delicate balance of
Han-minority relationships, while maintaining a strong central
government to prevent factionalisation of the military. In present-day
China under the Communist Party, a Han vs. minority “dual structure” has
been maintained due to the strong historical roots of ethnic tensions.
Although not as extreme as the divide-and-rule strategy between the Han
Chinese and minorities formulated by the Manchus in the Qing Dynasty,
the political structure is still centred around maintaining ethnic fault
lines and limiting ethnic integration to rigid conformance to the
dominant Han society.

These contemporary Chinese concepts of ethnicity and the relevant ethnic
policies originate from the Chinese definition of “nation” (*minzu
民族*). After the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, revolutionary leader
Sun Yat-sen embraced liberal ideals and proposed the founding of a
“republic of five groups”. Sun advocated for national unification, which
consisted of the “joining of the various groups of Han, Manchu, Mongol,
Hui Muslim and Tibetan into one nation.” The idea of all ethnic groups
unifying as one Chinese nation (*Zhonghua minzu 中华民族*) was
emphasised, which would re-establish China as the modern form of
“nation-state”. During the Republic of China (1912-1949), both the
Peking government (1912-1928) and Chiang Kai-Shek’s Nanjing Nationalist
Government (1928-1949) strongly insisted that there was only one
“nation” in China. They did not recognise other minority groups as
“nations” or “nationalities”, but only as lineage branches (ethnic
minorities) of the Chinese nation.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image12.png)
*“Five Races Under one Union” — The flag of the early Republic of China
(1912-1928). The five colours represent Han Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, Hui
Muslims and Tibetan respectively.*

Unlike the Republic of China (1912-1949), The People’s Republic of China
(PRC) adopted a different nationality policy as it espoused Stalin’s
theory and the Soviet model of “nationality formation”. The PRC
officially recognised 56 different nationalities in China, which became
the foundation of developing policies towards ethnic minorities. In
contrast to its predecessor, the PRC established itself as a
“multinationality republic” (*duo minzu guojia 多民族国家*). Under this
new structure, the term *minzu* has been applied on two levels: a
unified Chinese nation (*zhonghua minzu)* and the 56 nationalities
within it (Han Chinese and 55 minority groups). Autonomous regions,
prefectures, counties and towns have been established starting from the
1950s, and the Chinese government has implemented a series of
affirmative action policies for minority groups, including the exemption
from the one-child policy, bonus points awarded at university entrance
examinations, and financial subsidies. Although this new system has
given ethnic minorities systemic preferential protection, the
entitlement to these bonuses is purely based on race and identity
instead of personal merit or status. This has made the Han Chinese *—*
who do not enjoy these benefits *—* feel discriminated against, since
they would be permanently barred from the provision of the
aforementioned welfare perks despite constituting the bulk of the
Chinese population.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image10.jpg)
*Under the CCP’s new structure of nationalities, China has now
officially recognised 56 different ethnic groups. Yet, recognition from
the state belies the actual condition of ethnic relations in modern
China.*

This divide has currently manifested in the minority groups’ recognition
of their distinct identity from the Han majority, while the Han Chinese
now perceive themselves to be an ostracised group. In the light of the
terrorist attacks by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) in
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and political movements led by the
Tibetan Government in Exile in India, the Chinese government has been
identifying and denouncing foreign intervention as the main source of
ethnic instability, while turning public sentiment against the
minorities instead of the government’s own structural shortcomings. This
has heightened tensions and misunderstandings, with recent incidents of
self-immolation of Tibetans (there have been 148 cases since February
2009) sparking little public sympathy among the Han Chinese. Some
members of the Han Chinese community have even displayed public anger by
accusing minorities of being “ungrateful” towards the generous benefits
they have been receiving from the government.

Under the “dual structure”,
students from minority groups receive education in their own language
and enrol in *minzu* universities catered to the minorities, with little
involvement and interaction with Han Chinese in their education system,
who generally display little interest in the affairs of the minorities.
This gradual ethnic segregation in the Chinese school system and its
influence in the larger society has therefore resulted in an environment
that is less than conducive for economic development and the fostering
of knowledge exchange between the Han society and the minorities, as the
latter tends to hold lower proficiency levels in Mandarin Chinese and
thus encounter difficulties in finding jobs and securing a livelihood.
This leads to a lack of mutual cultural understanding, thereby posing
challenges for minorities to better integrate into society, while
simultaneously limiting their access to economic opportunities. The
“dual structure” manifesting in a set of concrete policies and unequal
treatment has thus aggravated the divide along ethnic lines and diluted
the Chinese people’s ethnic consciousness of their own nation.

In terms of governance, the CCP still employs pro-government ethnic
minority leaders in administrative positions, while maintaining a strong
governance as a central political authority. Additionally, it has been
consolidating its leadership through multiple hard-line anti-corruption
campaigns and reforming the military, while establishing a centralised
“Xi Jingping-core” leadership — something the Tang Dynasty could not
achieve. The series of preferential treatment and the acknowledgement of
the 56 nationalities may be perceived as a strategy by the Chinese
government to pacify the minority groups, while the establishment of the
separate sphere for minorities ensures adequate opportunities provided
for them in their own communities. However, these structures have
inevitably alienated the minority groups from the mainstream Han society
and politics. Ethnic representation in the government is made
proportional to population size, and it is increasingly difficult for
politicians of minority backgrounds to be raised to positions of power
compared to their Han counterparts. While the existing structure ensures
minority involvement in politics is kept to a minimum and a
Han-dominated political sphere is maintained, it has sparked dissent
among minorities for under-representation.

![](../static//img/alexander_roshan/media/image3.jpg)
*History repeats itself: With Chinese president Xi Jinping pursuing
hard-line reforms within the party and revamping the central leadership,
power has been increasingly centralised around the Han-dominated party
leadership.*

Thus, despite the recognition given to the minority groups under the
current system, its shortcomings have amplified the underlying
inter-racial fault lines in modern Chinese society, such as the multiple
interpretations of the term *“minzu”*, the different treatment towards
the Han Chinese and minorities, and the institutionalised segregation in
education and availability of opportunities in the social, economic and
political spheres. All of these have perpetuated a sense of ethnic
segregation and the dilution of a common Chinese national identity.

Amidst calls from critics and political activists for reviews and
reforms of the current system, we must not forget that the legacy of the
An Lushan Rebellion is a watershed event in Chinese history and a unique
cultural symbol. Crucially, the Rebellion, which was a military and
political catastrophe for the Chinese empire, has continued to play a
crucial role in shaping the mindset of current Chinese leaders. It has
moulded an increasingly centralised leadership and reinforcing the
necessity of maintaining greater control over the political and military
authority of minorities. The recent cases of dissatisfaction and unrest
among the Tibetans and Uyghurs can be mainly attributed to the
ineffectiveness of CCP’s dual structure in the case when both ethnic
groups have assimilated into the Han society to a lesser extent than
their ethnic counterparts. With cultures that are distinctly different
from that of the Han Chinese, they have found it harder to integrate
under the dual structure, which had not only failed to narrow the
Han-minority rift significantly, but also instilled a sense of unequal
treatment and subjugation among them.

Nevertheless, while the political structure of China has evolved
considerably, it continues to be pivoted on two forces acting together
concurrently: the centrifugal force of the conflicts and tensions
between the minorities and Han Chinese, and the centripetal force of the
common cultural background among the Han Chinese that unites them.
Throughout thousands of years, rulers of the historical dynasties and
the contemporary China have been subjected to the intangible influence
of these two forces. Thus, these forces highlight the underlying
historical consistency of the prolonged wariness of the Han Chinese
against minority groups, a continuity that transcends time and ideology,
undergirding the attitude of Chinese leaders towards minorities till
this day.

In retrospect, as the historical roots of Han-minority tensions lie
entrenched in the Chinese society, any possibility of the dismantling of
the existing Han vs. minorities “dual structure” remains slim.
Practically speaking, altering the nationalist ideology that has been
implemented for more than 60 years is no easy task. With the recent
reforms by President Xi aiming to consolidate the central leadership and
party ideology and more importantly, the unseen forces of history as an
invisible hand, rewriting the nationalist ideology entrenched in the
Chinese government’s policies will be a difficult task, if not an
impossible one.
